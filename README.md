# DSA-Codes
Data Structures And Algorithms 

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Arrays
- Basic array operations
- Practice codes for understanding indexing and traversal

### 🔹 Linked Lists
Implemented different types of linked lists:
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Singly Circular Linked List**
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**

These implementations help understand pointers, node connections, and traversal logic.

### 🔹 Stacks
- Stack implementation using basic logic
- Push, Pop, and Display operations

### 🔹 Queues
- Queue implementation
- Enqueue and Dequeue operations

### 🔹 Trees
- Basic Tree structure
- Understanding parent-child relationships in trees
